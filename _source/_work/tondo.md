Tondo aims to do for the art world what Hacker News did for the tech world. From discovering new works and exhibitions through to  nding a good place to get a painting framed,

Our brief was to build a website that facilitated engaging discussion. What we arrived at was a model that emulated Reddit’s voting system - users upvote content they like and downvote content they don’t, and weigh in with their opinions in the comments. My role in building this site was to build an SPA Backbone UI from which users could easily discover, engage with and create exciting new content.
