Time Magazine is among the longest runnning and most prestigious news publications in the country, but in order to remain relevant in an online age it needed a website that could deliver content in a fast and effortless way. The aim was to build a website that would “do for the minute what Time has always done for the week”, that is to deliver high quality, time-relevant content in an readable and hierarchical way.

With a small team of developers I was responsible for building a responsive interface built on Backbone.js that connected to Time's existing Wordpress-powered API. The new interface featured infinite scrolling, media-rich story formats and smartly-placed in-stream ads.
