Time Warner is the holding company behind some of the most popular TV shows and movies going, so in redesigning their corporate site we had a wealth of rich images and assets to work with. Their homepage was a good chance to showcase these assets alongside content relevant to investors and job-hunters, and we did so using an innovative tile system that literally split the page open to reveal video content behind the artwork.

This was a technically challenging project as we had to integrate a novel Angular UI with a legacy Drupal platform.

#### In numbers

In the year following launch we increased pageviews from 10MM in 2014 to 18MM in 2015. Engagement increased from 2 to 3 pages per visit and average session time increased 1:59 to 2:12.
