Sakuru is a self-started project that aimed to address the problem of memory retention on the web. Every day we come across interesting content but due to the nature of how we use the web, it is often usurped and forgotten in place of new content within a matter of days. Sakuru solves this problem by circulating content back into the user’s consciouscness through weekly digest emails. Content added to the Sakuru ‘stack’ is shown to the user at set times, thus re-enforcing the content and helping the user better remember valuable content.
